# Virtuoso maven repository

Maven repository distributing Openlink Virtuoso opensource Java libraries.

## About

I opened an issue some time ago to get virtuoso JDBC driver published to maven central ([virtuoso-opensource#249](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/issues/249)).

I think it's not reasonable to release to maven central code I don't maintain. But, for fun, I used nix package manager to run the build system used to generate the JDBC driver jars and Github Actions to automate their publication through a Github maven repository.

So... no, it's not yet into maven central ðŸ˜¢  
But it's easier to use in maven projects ðŸŽ‰
